Hello! My name is Haolin He. I am currently a first-year PhD student in the [DSP Lab](http://dsp.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/) of the Department of Electrical Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Qiuqiang Kong.

Before this, I graduated with honors from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, majoring in Communication Engineering.

My research interests include artificial intelligence and its applications in the processing of various digital signals, such as audio and neuroimaging.
